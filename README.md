## Installation

Go to [Download](https://www.arrow-dl.com/ArrowDL/category/download.html) page to install the application for your operating system.

Rem: *Native-Client* is an alternative to *ArrowDL*. Click [here](NativeClient.md "NativeClient.md") for more information.

On Windows, you can also use the [Chocolatey package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/arrowdl) to handle the installation/updates:
```powershell
choco install arrowdl
```

## Usage

Go to [Tutorial](https://www.arrow-dl.com/tutorial) page.

## Under the hood

*ArrowDL* is a standalone application, embedding its own web engine. That is, it aims to be free and independent, and not rely on any third-party Web Browser technology.

The internal web engine is currently:

* [Google Gumbo Parser](https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser "https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser"), for the **MinGW** and **GNU** versions. 

     Gumbo is a small pure-C HTML5 parser (but doesn't parse Javascript)

* [Chromium](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium "https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"), for the **MSVC** version.

     Chromium is a powerful web engine (parses HTML+Javascript)

When we give an URL address to *ArrowDL*, *ArrowDL* downloads the page, parses the HTML page and collects the links.

Due to rapid evolution of web technology, *ArrowDL* is designed to implement new parsers or add existing ones if required.

## Build with QtCreator on Windows

Assuming that the configured Kit in QtCreator is the auto-detected *Desktop Qt 6.3.1 MinGW 64-bit (by default)*. (see **Tools** > **Options** > **Kits**)

Assuming that libtorrent is already compiled.

1. **File** > **Open File or Project...**. 
   Select `./CMakeLists.txt`

1. Go to page **Debug**. Click **Configure**

1. Go to page **Projects**.
   Select **Build** > **Parameters**    
   Set the values:
    - *Boost_ROOT*: "path/to/Boost"
    - *LibtorrentRasterbar_ROOT*: "path/to/libtorrent"

    Eventually, if OpenSSL path is not recognized, set explicitly:
    - *OpenSSL_ROOT_DIR*: "(path/to/Qt6)/Tools/OpenSSL/Win_x64"

    Moreover,
    - *CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX*: Chose another install path.

1. Click **Run CMake**.

1. Go to page **Editor**. Build. Run.

1. To install: go to page **Projects**.
    Select **Build** > **Parameters**.
    In Step *Build*, check *install* amongst the targets, thus CMake will build and install.
