### Happy New Year 2024!

Thanks to all the upgrades in 2023, 2024 looks brighter!

C++20 offers more simplification and abstraction,
Qt6 offers better widgets,
OpenSSL 3.0 offers better security,
and LibTorrent offers better functions.
*ArrowDL* will be improved a lot, for sure :)

**Happy New Year 2024! :)**
