Version 2.0.0 is available

#### Remarkable Changes

Some GUI changes, especially a *Home* button to simplify the download choice.

Indeed there are now 4 categories of downloadable things:

- **Web Page Content**: takes a webpage URL as input, and downloads its content: media, links...
- **Single file** / **Batch of files**: takes a file URL as input, or a Regular Expression representing web links, and downloads this list.
- **Video/Audio Stream**: takes an address of Youtube or similar site and transforms the video stream into a media file.
- **Magnet Link, Torrent**: downloads the content of a *.torrent* file.
