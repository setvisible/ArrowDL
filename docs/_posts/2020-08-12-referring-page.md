**DownZemAll!** offers a new feature: *Referring Page*.

*Wikipedia says:*

> The **HTTP referer** (a misspelling of *referrer*) is an optional HTTP header field that identifies the address of the webpage (i.e., the URI or IRI) which is linked to the resource being requested. By checking the referer, the new webpage can see where the request originated.
>
> In the most common situation this means that when a user clicks a hyperlink in a web browser, the browser sends a request to the server holding the destination webpage. The request may include the referer field, which indicates the last page the user was on (the one where they clicked the link).
>
> Referer logging is used to allow websites and web servers to identify where people are visiting them from, for promotional or statistical purposes.
>
> The default behaviour of referer leaking puts websites at risk of privacy and security breaches.[1]


## How to set up your default referring page

Go to **Options** > **Preferences** > **Privacy**, and type the  default referring page address:
