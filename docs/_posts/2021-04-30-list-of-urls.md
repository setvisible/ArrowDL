## New Feature: Download Urls

![Icon](/ArrowDL/assets/images/2.3/paste_48x48.png)

From now on, **ArrowDL** can download a list of Urls.

Just copy-paste the list of URLs to download in the dialog:

Note that:
- the text editor is tolerant to extra spaces and extra lines (**ArrowDL** will not download empty lines!)
- There's the "*Block*" edition mode, which allows to change several lines in a row.
- Obviously there are the *copy, paste, cut, undo, redo* things.

Last but not the least, do not hesitate to compliment the icon ![Icon](/ArrowDL/assets/images/2.3/paste_48x48.png) (I did it myself with [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/)...).
