<h1>introduction</h1>
<p>libtorrent is a feature complete C++ bittorrent implementation focusing
on efficiency and scalability. It runs on embedded devices as well as
desktops. It boasts a well documented library interface that is easy to
use. It comes with a simple bittorrent client demonstrating the use of
the library.</p>
<p>BitTorrent v2 is supported as of libtorrent 2.0. This replaces the previous
merkle hash tree extension.</p>

<div class="section" id="features">
<h1>features</h1>
<p>libtorrent is an ongoing project under active development. Its
current state supports and includes the following features:</p>
<div class="section" id="bittorrent-v2">
<h2>BitTorrent v2</h2>
<p>Starting with version 2.0, libtorrent supports BitTorrent V2 (as specified in
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0052.html">BEP 52</a>). BitTorrent V2 introduces a new format for .torrent files, which generally
has a smaller info-dict than the original format. The .torrent files still contain
piece hashes by default, but they can also be downloaded from peers.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Files are organized in a directory structure, instead of listing full paths.
Torrents that have a lot of files in deep directory structures will use a lot
less space to represent that structure in a v2 torrent.</li>
<li>Piece hashes are organized in a merkle hash trees per file, and only the
roots of the trees are included in the .torrent file. The actual hashes are
delivered by peers.</li>
</ol>
<p>The hash tree allows validating payload received from a peer immediately, down
to 16 kiB blocks. In the original bittorrent protocol a whole piece would have
to be downloaded before it could be validated against the hashes.</p>
<p>The fact that each file has its own hash tree, and that its leaves are defined
to be 16 kiB, means that files with identical content will always have the same
merkle root. This enables finding matches of the same file across different
torrents.</p>
<p>The new format for torrent files is compatible with the original torrent file
format, which enables <em>hybrid</em> torrents. Such torrents that can be used both as
V1 and V2 and will have two swarms, one with V1 and V2 clients and one with only
V2 clients.</p>
<p>Another major feature of the BitTorrent V2 protocol is that the SHA-1 hash
function has been replaced by SHA-256.</p>

<div class="section" id="highlighted-features">
<h1>highlighted features</h1>
<div class="section" id="disk-i-o">
<h2>disk I/O</h2>
<p>All disk I/O in libtorrent is done asynchronously to the network thread, by the
disk io threads. Files are mapped into memory and the kernel's page cache is
relied on for caching disk blocks. This has the advantage that the disk cache
size adapts to global system load and memory pressure, maximizing the cache
without bogging down the whole system. Since memory mapped I/O is inherently
synchronous, files can be accessed from multiple disk I/O threads.</p>
<p>Similarly, for write requests, blocks are queued in a store-buffer while waiting
to be flushed to disk. Read requests that happen before a block has been
flushed, will short circuit by picking the block from the store buffer.</p>
<p>Memory mapped files are available on Windows and posix 64 bit systems. When
building on other, simpler platforms, or 32 bits, a simple portable and
single-threaded disk I/O back-end is available, using <cite>fopen()</cite> and <cite>fclose()</cite>
family of functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="network-buffers">
<h2>network buffers</h2>
<p>On CPUs with small L2 caches, copying memory can be expensive operations. It is important
to keep copying to a minimum on such machines. This mostly applies to embedded systems.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the number of times received data is copied, the receive buffer
for payload data is received directly into a page aligned disk buffer. If the connection
is encrypted, the buffer is decrypted in-place. The buffer is then moved into the disk
cache without being copied. Once all the blocks for a piece have been received, or the
cache needs to be flushed, all the blocks are passed directly to <tt class="docutils literal">writev()</tt> to flush
them in a single system call. This means a single copy into user space memory, and a single
copy back into kernel memory, as illustrated by this figure:</p>
<img alt="img/write_disk_buffers.png" class="bw" src="img/write_disk_buffers.png" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>When seeding and uploading in general, unnecessary copying is avoided by caching blocks
in aligned buffers, that are copied once into the peer's send buffer. The peer's send buffer
is not guaranteed to be aligned, even though it is most of the time. The send buffer is
then encrypted with the peer specific key and chained onto the <tt class="docutils literal">iovec</tt> for sending.
This means there is one user space copy in order to allow unaligned peer requests and
peer-specific encryption. This is illustrated by the following figure:</p>
<img alt="img/read_disk_buffers.png" class="bw" src="img/read_disk_buffers.png" style="width: 100%;" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="piece-picker">
<h2>piece picker</h2>
<p>The piece picker is a central component in a bittorrent implementation. The piece picker
in libtorrent is optimized for quickly finding the rarest pieces. It keeps a list of all
available pieces sorted by rarity, and pieces with the same rarity, shuffled. The rarest
first mode is the dominant piece picker mode. Other modes are supported as well, and
used by peers in specific situations.</p>
<p>The piece picker allows to combine the availability of a piece with a priority. Together
they determine the sort order of the piece list. Pieces with priority 0 will never be
picked, which is used for the selective download feature.</p>
<p>In order to have as few partially finished pieces as possible, peers have an affinity
towards picking blocks from the same pieces as other peers in the same speed category.
The speed category is a coarse categorization of peers based on their download rate. This
makes slow peers pick blocks from the same piece, and fast peers pick from the same piece,
and hence decreasing the likelihood of slow peers blocking the completion of pieces.</p>
<p>The piece picker can also be set to download pieces in sequential order.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="share-mode">
<h2>share mode</h2>
<p>The share mode feature in libtorrent is intended for users who are only interested in
helping out swarms, not downloading the torrents.</p>
<p>It works by predicting the demand for pieces, and only download pieces if there is enough
demand. New pieces will only be downloaded once the share ratio has hit a certain target.</p>
<p>This feature is especially useful when combined with RSS, so that a client can be set up
to provide additional bandwidth to an entire feed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customizable-file-i-o">
<h2>customizable file I/O</h2>
<img alt="img/storage.png" class="bw align-right" src="img/storage.png" />
<p>libtorrent's disk I/O implementation is customizable. That means a special
purpose bittorrent client can replace the default way to store files on disk.</p>
<p>When implementing a bittorrent cache, it doesn't matter how the data is stored on disk, as
long as it can be retrieved and seeded. In that case a new disk I/O class can be implemented
(inheriting from the <a class="reference external" href="reference-Custom_Storage.html#disk_interface">disk_interface</a>) that avoids the unnecessary step of mapping
pieces to files and offsets. The storage can ignore the file boundaries and just store the
entire torrent in a single file (which will end up being all the files concatenated). The main
advantage of this, other than a slight CPU performance gain, is that all file operations would
be page (and sector) aligned. This enables efficient unbuffered I/O, and can potentially
lead to more efficient read caching (using the built in disk cache rather than relying on the
operating system's disk cache).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="easy-to-use-api">
<h2>easy to use API</h2>
<p>One of the design goals of the libtorrent API is to make common operations simple, but still
have it possible to do complicated and advanced operations. This is best illustrated by example
code to implement a simple bittorrent client:</p>

<h1>portability</h1>
<p>libtorrent runs on most major operating systems including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Windows</li>
<li>macOS</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>BSD</li>
<li>Solaris</li>
</ul>
<p>It uses Boost.Asio, Boost.Optional, Boost.System, Boost.Multiprecision,
Boost.Pool, Boost.Python (for bindings), Boost.CRC and various
other boost libraries. At least version 1.70 of boost is required.</p>
<p>Since libtorrent uses Boost.Asio it will take full advantage of high performance
network APIs on the most popular platforms. I/O completion ports on windows,
epoll on Linux and kqueue on macOS and BSD.</p>
<p>libtorrent requires a C++11 compiler and does not build with the following compilers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>GCC older than 5.4</li>
<li>Visual Studio older than Visual Studio 15 2017 (aka msvc-14.1)</li>
